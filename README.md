## About Me  

I’m a ~~creative technologist~~ / ~~design technologist~~ — basically, a **designer who codes** ❤️ based in Dubai.  
Curious about how things work, obsessed with making them better, and not shy about sharing what I learn.  

Currently building **Wayzi** — an accessibility and token suite for real, inclusive design — and **Smart Links**, a smarter way to manage shareable links.  

I’ve also created a collection of Craft CMS plugins born from real client needs. Beyond that, I work on client projects, and I teach and mentor other designers whenever I can (something I hope to do more of).

 ## Craft CMS Plugin Collection

  I've developed Craft CMS plugins that enhance form functionality, streamline content management, and enable enterprise integrations. These plugins
   originated from real client requirements and continue to evolve based on project needs and feedback.

  ### Formie Extensions
  *Field types and integrations for [Formie](https://verbb.io/craft-plugins/formie/features)*

  - **[Formie Paragraph Field](https://github.com/LindemannRock/craft-formie-paragraph-field)**
    Multi-line paragraph field with configurable text sizes, Twig rendering support, and full translation compatibility. Ideal for rich content forms and stylized
   text blocks.

  - **[Formie Rating Field](https://github.com/LindemannRock/craft-formie-rating-field)**
    Comprehensive rating system featuring star ratings, emoji feedback, and NPS scoring. Includes half-star precision, RTL language support, and extensive
  customization options.

  - **[Formie REST API](https://github.com/LindemannRock/craft-formie-rest-api)**
    Full-featured REST and GraphQL API with OAuth 2.0 authentication, intelligent rate limiting, and flexible response formats. Perfect for headless applications
  and third-party integrations.

  - **[Formie SAP Integration](https://github.com/LindemannRock/craft-formie-sap-integration)**
    Direct integration with SAP Cloud Platform using OAuth 2.0 authentication and dynamic schema mapping. Built for enterprise environments with comprehensive
  error handling and logging.

  ### Core Development Tools
  *Essential utilities for modern Craft CMS workflows*

  - **[Icon Manager](https://github.com/LindemannRock/craft-icon-manager)**
    Advanced SVG icon management with metadata support, organized folder structures, and custom field types. Streamlines icon workflows across large projects.

  - **[Smart Links](https://github.com/LindemannRock/craft-smart-links)**
    Intelligent URL management with device-specific redirects, QR code generation, detailed analytics, and multi-environment configuration support.

  - **[Slideshow Manager](https://github.com/LindemannRock/craft-slideshow-manager)**
    Comprehensive slideshow management with Swiper.js integration. Features automatic CDN asset loading, per-entry configuration, responsive breakpoints, and 40+ CSS custom properties for complete styling control.

  - **[Translation Manager](https://github.com/LindemannRock/craft-translation-manager)**
    Comprehensive solution for managing multilingual content with workflow automation and team collaboration features.

  - **[Component Manager](https://github.com/LindemannRock/craft-component-manager)**
    Component-based template system that promotes reusability and maintainability in Twig templates, reducing code duplication across projects.

  ### Development Infrastructure
  *Shared libraries for consistent plugin development*

  - **[Logging Library](https://github.com/LindemannRock/craft-logging-library)**
    Reusable logging infrastructure providing dedicated log files, web-based log viewer, automatic user context, and Monolog integration. Enables
  consistent logging across all LindemannRock plugins with edge/CDN environment detection.

  ### Development Philosophy
  These plugins are actively maintained and enhanced based on real-world usage and client feedback. I plan to submit them to the official Craft Plugin Store once
  they reach maturity and have been thoroughly tested in production environments.
